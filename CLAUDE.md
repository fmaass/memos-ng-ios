# memos-ng-ios

Native SwiftUI client for memos-ng, and the reference iOS project new iOS apps are cloned from.
The architecture and its reasoning live in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (doctrine v0, proposed). The
rules below are the executable part — the ones a change can break.

## The gate is the only build authority

Swift cannot be built on the Linux machine this repo is developed on. Every build, test, lint and
dependency check runs on the Mac build host through one script:

    MAC_GATE_HOST=merkur.local bin/mac-gate.sh

It refuses (exit 2) if the tree has no HEAD or if its remote target resolves outside
`~/build/memos-ng-ios/gate/`, mirrors the worktree with `rsync --delete`, and runs, fail-fast:
`bin/generate.sh` (which also asserts the version keys in the generated project) → the
entitlement greps (the app declares the credential keychain group first and the app group
second, read by index; the share extension declares no keychain group; both declare the app
group as a positive control) → `swift format lint --strict --recursive .` → the dependency-pin
check (below) → `xcodebuild test` (all five test bundles) → a read-back of the BUILT app and
.appex (each one's `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, its version keys and its export-compliance answer) →
a rebuild of every package with its warnings fatal (`swift build -warnings-as-errors` for the four
that declare macOS; MemosFeatures through `xcodebuild` for the simulator, where the fatality comes
from its own manifest) → the dependency-rule greps → a
per-bundle test-count check. It ends with one summary line of every step's exit code and
returns the first non-zero one. The `.xcresult` and any screenshots come back to
`MAC_GATE_ARTIFACTS` (default `.gate-artifacts/`, gitignored).

Two steps run before any of that, on the machine you are working from. The classifier test
(`tests/gate/fastpath-classify-test.sh`) checks the gate's own docs-only classifier against
throwaway repositories it builds itself — it is the gate's integrity check and runs on every gate.
Then the change set is classified: what this branch changed against `origin/main` (merge-base,
renames not followed, so a rename is judged by both of its names) plus everything staged, edited or
untracked in the working tree. When every one of those paths is documentation or repository
metadata — `docs/`, any `.md`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.editorconfig`, `CODEOWNERS`,
`LICENSE` — and none of them is a symbolic link, the gate reports `PASS (fast path: docs-only)`,
names every changed path and the base it measured from, and copies nothing to the build host.
Anything else meets the full gate: `project.yml`, every manifest, xcconfig, entitlement and plist,
every source file, this script and its own tests. The release-version check runs on both paths, so
a version bump can never take the fast path. Every run writes what it classified to
`.gate-artifacts/classification.txt`, fast path or not. `bin/mac-gate.sh --classify-only` prints
that classification and stops, without needing a build host.

A task is not done until that summary line reads `| exit=0`. Never cite a piped or filtered
summary — the exit code is the verdict.

**Git is the only medium between the two machines.** The gate directory is a mirror, never a
checkout, and it is never opened in Xcode. A hands-on clone on the Mac lives at
`~/projects/memos-ng-ios`, is never an rsync target, and nothing writes there.

## The dependency rule

    App target (composition only)
       └── MemosFeatures  →  MemosCore  →  MemosAPI

Nothing imports Features. The rule is enforced by the package manifests and checked mechanically
by the gate, with a positive control in the same run:

    grep -n "MemosCore\|MemosFeatures" Packages/MemosAPI/Package.swift      → 0 hits
    grep -n "MemosFeatures"            Packages/MemosCore/Package.swift     → 0 hits
    grep -n "MemosCore"                Packages/MemosFeatures/Package.swift → ≥ 1 (control)

Because that check is a literal text grep, a manifest may not name a layer above it **even inside
a comment**. A check a comment can defeat is not a check.

## Concurrency

Swift 6 language mode and complete strict concurrency in every target and every package, declared
explicitly (`swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]`, `SWIFT_VERSION 6.0` + `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY complete`).
MainActor default isolation on the app and the Features layer; the API layer stays `nonisolated`,
because its middleware is called off the main actor by the transport. Every type crossing a package
boundary is `Sendable`. No Combine — Observation and structured concurrency cover it.

Every package builds with its warnings fatal; a warning is a defect. Four of them take
`-warnings-as-errors` from the gate's command line. MemosFeatures cannot: SwiftPM has no iOS
destination for it, and every way of asking `xcodebuild` for that setting also reaches the
dependencies, so a warning in MarkdownUI or OpenAPIKit would fail the gate. It declares
`.treatAllWarnings(as: .error)` on its own target instead. Dropping that line does not fail
anything — the build still succeeds, the warnings simply stop being fatal — so the gate touches
that target's sources, builds, and reads the log back: a compiler invocation for the MemosFeatures
target carrying `-warnings-as-errors`, with the count of that target's build tasks as the control
on the read. The build log comes back as `.gate-artifacts/MemosFeatures-warnings-build.log`.

## Tests

Swift Testing (`import Testing`), never XCTest for new tests. Every new or changed function gets a
test, and a test must fail when the behaviour breaks.

- **Mock the generated `APIProtocol`'s transport, never the store.** The stores ARE the unit under
  test; substituting them proves nothing. `StubTransport` in MemosCoreTests hands the real
  generated client a scripted transport, so the request the store builds, the middleware that
  attaches the token and the decoding are all exercised.
- The Markdown layer is held to `Packages/MemosAPI/Sources/MemosAPI/Fixtures/markdown-parity.json`,
  vendored from memos-ng. Every case carries its own Markdown input; the suite renders it and
  asserts the committed projection. Do not edit that file by hand — re-run `scripts/sync-openapi.sh`.
- Pure functions ported from the SPA (`stripTagOnlyLines`, `isTagOnlyLine`, `toggleTask`,
  `taskCheckboxLines`) carry the SAME vectors as their vitest specs. If one changes, both sides
  change together or the port is broken.

## The generated client

`Packages/MemosAPI` generates its client from a vendored `openapi.json` at build time. Both it and
the parity fixture are synced from ONE memos-ng commit:

    MEMOS_NG_REPO=/path/to/memos-ng scripts/sync-openapi.sh <40-char-sha>

The commit, its subject and the files it wrote are recorded in `Packages/MemosAPI/OPENAPI_SOURCE`.
Never hand-write a client method: if something will not generate, fix the contract.

The sync vendors `openapi.json` VERBATIM: the committed file is byte-for-byte
`git show <sha>:openapi.json` in memos-ng, so provenance is checkable with one command. Keep it
that way — memos-ng emits OAS 3.1 nullable type arrays (`type: ["string", "null"]`) natively, so
no rewrite is needed. It was not always so: swift-openapi-generator silently DROPS a property
written as `anyOf: [X, {"type": "null"}]`, `MemoList.nextCursor` included, which is why a
`scripts/normalize-openapi.py` step canonicalised the idiom until memos-ng 433a3fe. If nullable
properties ever vanish from the generated types again, fix the contract in memos-ng rather than
reintroducing a transform here.

If a test bundle needs `OpenAPIRuntime` or `HTTPTypes` directly, it is declared twice — in
`project.yml` and in the package manifest. Keep the versions in step; SwiftPM resolves one graph
and refuses a conflict.

## Project file

`MemosNG.xcodeproj` is generated by XcodeGen from `project.yml` and is NOT committed. Edit
`project.yml`; run `bin/generate.sh` after cloning (it stubs the per-machine `signing.local.yml` —
see `signing.local.yml.example` for device signing). Never commit a `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, a
provisioning profile, a server URL default, or a token.

## Dependency pins

`Package.resolved` at the repo root is the whole resolved dependency graph, and it is committed.
SwiftPM reads that file from inside the project
(`MemosNG.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/`), which is generated and therefore
absent from a clone, so `bin/generate.sh` copies the tracked file in before anything resolves.
Pinning the direct dependencies in `project.yml` with `exactVersion` would not be the same thing:
eight of the thirteen packages the app links are transitive and named in no manifest in this
repo, so their versions would still float.

The gate's `pins` step resolves against the restored file and compares what came back with what is
tracked, package by package: the version, the exact commit, and the repository it came from. SwiftPM rewrites that file whenever a pin
cannot satisfy the manifests, so a mismatch IS drift — a dependency added, a requirement bumped
past its pin, a hand edit — and the step fails with a `PINS FAIL:` line naming every package that
moved. `xcodebuild test` then runs with `-onlyUsePackageVersionsFromResolvedFile`, so the build
itself cannot resolve its way to a version the file does not name.

After a deliberate dependency change the pins are re-recorded, not hand-edited: every run leaves
what it resolved in `.gate-artifacts/Package.resolved`, so `cp .gate-artifacts/Package.resolved
Package.resolved` and commit that.

## Outgoing text

Anything that leaves this repo under my name — App Store listing text, release notes, a public
README, an issue or a PR body — is first-person **singular**, carries **no AI attribution** (no
"Generated with…", no `Co-authored-by`, no bot sign-off), and leaks nothing internal (no ticket
keys, no internal hostnames, no estate paths). Verification claims must be literally true.
